// Exercise 15.02:
/*
 How does the protected access specifier differ from private?
 
 // "However, sometimes a base class has members that it wants to let its derived classes use while still prohibiting access to those same members by other users. We specify such members after a protected access specifier."
 // "Our Quote class expects its derived classes to define their own net_price function. To do so, those classes need access to the price member. As a result, Quote defines that member as protected." â€“ pg. 595
