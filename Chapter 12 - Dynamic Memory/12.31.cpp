// Exercise 12.31:
/*
 What difference(s) would it make if we used a vector instead of a set to hold the line numbers? Which approach is better?
 Why?
 
 >> The vector would record instances where the query occured more than once in one line, which might be beneficial for overall occurences, rather than recording instances of line appearances like a set would do.
 >> Both have unique benefits, but it all depends on the desired outocome of the programme.
