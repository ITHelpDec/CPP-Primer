// Exercise 7.56:
/*
 What is a static class member?
 >> A static class member is a member associated with the class, rather than the individual objects of the class type
 
 What are the advantages of static members?
 >> It's efficient (no reason for each object to store a copy of the member â€“ it's constant throughout)
 >> When the static member value changes, it is reflected in the calculations of other members
 >> A static data member can have incomplete type
 >> Can be used as a default argument
 
 How do they differ from ordinary members?
 >> A static member belongs to the class, whereas a nonstatic member belongs to the objects of the class
