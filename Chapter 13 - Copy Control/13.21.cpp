// Exercise 13.21:
/*
 Do you think the TextQuery and QueryResult classes need to define their own versions of the copy-control members?
 If so, why?
 If not, why not?
 Implement whichever copy-control operations you think these classes require.
 
 >> You could declare the copy-control members for the TextQuery and QueryResult class, but there's no need â€“ the synthesised versions will do the job just fine.
