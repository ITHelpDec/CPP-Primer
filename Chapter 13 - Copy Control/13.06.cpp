// Exercise 13.06:
/*
 What is a copy-assignment operator? When is this operator used?
 What does the synthesized copy-assignment operator do? When is it synthesized?
 
 >> "A copy-assignment operator (operator=) assigns each nonstatic memeber of the right-hand object to the corresponding member of the left-hand object using the copy-assignment operator for the type of that member...the [synthesised] copy-assignement operator returns a reference to its left-hand object." – pg. 500
 
 "..., the compiler synthesises a copy-assignment operator if the class does not define its own." – pg. 500
