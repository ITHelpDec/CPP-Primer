// Exercise 11.06:
/*
 Explain the difference between a set and a list.
 When might you use one or the other?
 
 A set is an associative container, whereas a list is a sequential container
 
 Elements in a list can be manually sorted by the programmer, whereas elements in a set are sorted by default (unless it's an unsorted version)
 
 A list is ordered by default, whereas a set is un-ordered.
 
 We can't enforce an arbitrary order by placing an arbitrary element in an arbitrary position in a set.
