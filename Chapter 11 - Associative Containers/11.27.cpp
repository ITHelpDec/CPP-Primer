// Exercise 11.27:
/*
 What kinds of problems would you use count to solve? When might you use find instead?
 
 >> I would use .count() for the likes of multimaps where we would want to know the number of instances a given key appears
 >> I would use find when working with associative containers that do not have multiple records of the same key e.g. is the key present?
