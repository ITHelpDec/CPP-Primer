// Exercise 14.46:
/*
 Explain whether defining these Sales_data conversion operators is a good idea and whether they should be explicit.
 
 >> Coversion operators in general is a bad idea.
 >> If we need to define them then they should be explicit to avoid implicit conversion, but otherwise it's safer to define specific member functions
*/
