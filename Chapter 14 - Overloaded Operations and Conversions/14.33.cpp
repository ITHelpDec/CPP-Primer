// Exercise 14.33:
/*
 How many operands may an overloaded function-call operator take?
 
 >> "An overloaded oeprator function has the same number of parameters as the operator has operands. Hence, the maximum value should be 256".
 
 >> This can be seen in "Annex B â€“ implementation quantities" of the C++ Language
 
 // "Parameters in one function definition [256]."
 // "Arguments in one function call [256]."
