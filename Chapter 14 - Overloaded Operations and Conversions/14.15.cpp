// Exercise 14.15:
/*
 Should the class you chose for exercise 7.40 from ยง 7.5.1 (p. 291) define any of the arithmetic operators?
 If so, implement them.
 If not, explain why not.
 
 >> I wouldn't, personally.
 >> I don't feel there's a need to perform arithmetic work to colours, ignition states or gears - there are already functions to shift gears up and down and turn the car on and off
