// Exercise 9.08:
/*
 What type should be used to read elements in a list of strings? To write them?
 
 >> std::list<string>::const_iterator or std::list<string>::iterator can be used to read,
 >> but only std::list<string>::iterator can be used to write
 >> remember: const protects you from over-writing by mistake
*/
