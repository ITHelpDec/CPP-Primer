// Exercise 16.32:
/*
 What happens during template argument deduction?
 
 >> "We've seen that, by default, the compiler uses the argument in a call to determine the template parameters for a function template."
 
 >> "The process of determining template arguments from the function arguments is known as TEMPLATE ARGUMENT DEDUCTION."
 
 >> "During template argument deduction, the compiler uses types to the arguments in the call to find the template arguments that generate a version of the function that bet matches the given call." â€“ pg. 678
