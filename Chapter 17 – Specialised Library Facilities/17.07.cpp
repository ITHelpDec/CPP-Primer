// Exercise 17.07:
/*
 Explain which version of findBook you prefer and why.
*/

// I much prefer the use of another struct or class.

// The ability to give more-easily-identifiable member names like...

Matches().sz_
Matches().cbegin_
Matches().cend_

// ...over...

std::get<i>(std::tuple<Args>)

// ...or...

std::pair<Size, std::pair<It, It>>

// ...make this an easy choice (for me, anyway)
