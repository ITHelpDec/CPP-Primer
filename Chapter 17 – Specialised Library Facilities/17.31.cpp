/*
 What would happen if we defined b and e inside the do loop of the game-playing program from this section?
 
 >> "Because enginers return the same sequence of numbers, it is essential that we declare engines out of loops. Otherwise, we'd create a new engine on each iteration and generate the same values on each iteration. Similarly, distributions may retain state and should also be defined outside loops" â€“ pg. 752
